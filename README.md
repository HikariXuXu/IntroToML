# IntroToML
The code of WashU 2022 Spring CSE417T.
1. **hw0.py** & **hw1.py**: **Perceptron learning algorithm (PLA)** scource code implementation.
2. **hw1_3.py**: Use flipping coins experiments to explore Hoeffding bound.
3. **hw2.py**: **Logistic Regression** source code implementation. The data are in clevelandtrain.csv.
4. **hw2_3.py**: Experiments about bias and variance.
5. **hw3.py**: Update the implementation of logistic regression in hw2.py to include the **$L_1$ and $L_2$ regularizers**. The data are in digits_preprocess.npy.
6. **hw4.py**: **Bagging decision trees** implementation only with sklearn.*tree.DecisionTreeClassifier* function. The data are zip.train and zip.test, which are hand-written digit recognition problems.
7. **hw5.py**: **Adaboost** implementation with only *sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier* function. The problem is the same as hw4.py.
8. **hw5_3.py**: Draw the four input points and maximal margin separator in the original Euclidean input space.
